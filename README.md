- 👋 Hi, I’m @harisoche
- 👀 I’m interested in Java, Golang and Python for now
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Golang, Laravel and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project with Java, Golang or Python so I can learn new methodology or any programming way.
- 📫 How to reach me ? just email me at haris@ochedev.me

I know a little about Telegram Bot with Java, Java Restful, Spring-boot, Hibernate, Spring-batch and Selenium with Java. For Python I still learn the fundamental, 
but I already know a little about Django Rest Framework and selenium in Python.
